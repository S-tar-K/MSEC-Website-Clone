                <h1>Department Profile</h1>
                <p>The Department of Biotechnology was established in the year 2002 by offering B.Tech Biotechnology program. The department also offers M.Tech Biotechnology, part-time and full-time Ph.D programs in Biotechnology. The B.Tech program conferred with accreditation from NBA, New Delhi under Tier I category. The department has specialized faculty in the areas of Molecular Biology, Genetic Engineering, Bioprocess and Chemical Engineering, Nanobiotechnology, Microbial Technology and Computational Biology. The excellent performance by our students in GATE, CSIR and other All-India competitive examinations has placed them in industries like Biocon, Saksin Life Sciences, GE Healthcare, etc., and premier institutions like IITs in India and Universities abroad. The department houses state of the art genomic and proteomic facility, fermentation unit, plant and animal tissue culture facility, radioactive laboratory, animal house with approvals from government agencies like Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), Mumbai and Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments (CPCSEA), Ministry of Forests and Environment, New Delhi.
                    Our students are given hands on training in modern tools of Biotechnology in our laboratories. One of the unique characteristics of the courses offered by our department is we are having limited strength of 60 and 18 students per batch for our B.Tech and M.Tech courses, respectively to facilitate effective teaching and learning process.
                    As many of our illustrious alumni stated 'the department provides intellectual effervescence in a highly stimulating research and academic environment which could mould students to readily fit into challenging industrial and academic settings across the world'.</p>
